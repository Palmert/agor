# Agor: A Multiplayer-ready, Spatial Layer for Agentic Coding

Agent orchestration meets a real-time spatial board. Agor coordinates Claude Code, Codex, Gemini, and more with session trees, zone-triggered workflows, and isolated git worktrees that each run their own environments.

## Why this matters

Today’s agentic coding is powerful, but still linear: terminal chats, slow handoffs, limited visibility, and environment friction. Agor turns that into a multiplayer canvas where you can see all sessions at once, branch conversations without losing context, and share running environments across teammates and agents.

## What you can do

- Spatial Canvas: Organize sessions on a 2D board; presence and spatial memory make collaboration natural.
- Session Trees: Fork to parallelize, spawn to delegate—fresh, clean context without polluting the parent.
- Worktrees + Environments: Each worktree is isolated, with its own dev server and unique ports.
- Zone Triggers: Drag to a zone to auto-run templated prompts with live board/worktree/session context.
- SDK-first Orchestration: Coordinate Claude Code, Codex, and Gemini via SDKs, with MCP baked in.

## Quick start

**Install globally (recommended):**

```bash
npm install -g agor-live
agor daemon start
agor ui open
```

**Or try in Codespaces** (for team collaboration):

[Open in Codespaces](https://codespaces.new/mistercrunch/agor?quickstart=1&devcontainer_path=.devcontainer%2Fplayground%2Fdevcontainer.json) - Get a publicly accessible URL to share with teammates

**Or run with Docker** (for contributing):

```bash
docker compose up
# Visit http://localhost:5173 → Login: admin@agor.live / admin
```

## How Agor is different

Agor isn’t “another CLI” or chat UI—it’s an orchestration layer that spans your tools.

- Multiplayer-first: presence, comments, real-time updates
- Spatial by design: location-as-memory beats long, linear scrollbacks
- Agent-native: SDK-first with session-scoped MCP, not brittle CLI parsing

## Who it’s for

- Solo builders juggling multiple agents and tasks
- Teams that need async handoffs, shared running environments, and live visibility

## Roadmap highlights

- Close SDK parity with native CLIs
- Bring-your-own IDE flows (connect VSCode/Cursor to Agor-managed worktrees)
- Automated reports and a composable context system
